  On a cobweb afternoon<br></br>
In a room full of emptiness<br></br>
By a freeway I confess<br></br>
I was lost in the pages<br></br>
Of a book full of death<br></br>
Reading how we'll die alone<br></br>
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest<br></br>
Anywhere we want to go<br></br>
In your house, I long to be<br></br>
Room by room, patiently<br></br>
I'll wait for you there<br></br>
<b>Like a stone</b><br></br>
I'll wait for you there<br></br>
<b>Alone</b><br></br>
And on my deathbed I will pray<br></br>
To the gods and the angels<br></br>
Like a pagan to anyone<br></br>
Who will take me to heaven<br></br>
To a place I recall<br></br>
I was there so long ago<br></br>
The sky was bruised<br></br>
The wine was bled<br></br>
And there you led me on<br></br>
In your house, I long to be<br></br>
Room by room, patiently<br></br>
I'll wait for you there<br></br>
<b>Like a stone</b><br></br>
I'll wait for you there<br></br>
<b>Alone</b><br></br>
<b>Alone</b><br></br>
And on I read<br></br>
Until the day was gone<br></br>
And I sat in regret<br></br>
Of all the things I've done<br></br>
For all that I've blessed<br></br>
And all that I've wronged<br></br>
In dreams until my death<br></br>
I will wander on<br></br>
In your house, I long to be<br></br>
Room by room, patiently<br></br>
I'll wait for you there<br></br>
<b>Like a stone</b> <br></br>
I'll wait for you there<br></br>
<b>Alone</b><br></br>
<b>Alone</b><br></br>
